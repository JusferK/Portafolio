                        Hello, my name is Justine, I'm 22 y.o. and currently I'm web developer jr from Guatemala. I'm currently studying
                        software engineer at Mariano Galvez from Guatemala and I'm also currently getting a fullstack course from 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> that is teaching me the front-end and
                        back-end from a web aplication. This is not the first of me getting a certification, I have a section in which a
                        I show all the certifications I have. The completion of this portafolio is part of one the proyects from CodeCademy
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        I'm passionate to learn all about computing, to know how is that human is able to communicate using maths, 
                        so the computer is able to do whatever the humans wants it to do. I consider my self someone that is discipline and
                        always finishing what I start. that's why software engineer is what I decided to do because it requires a lot of time
                        for you to learn the science of computing, not only programming but what being an software engineer requires/knows to
                        do. Soon I'll be able to say that I know how to communicate with computers thanks to the amount of studies I'm taking
                        and sacrificies and making right now. 
                    </p>

                <p>When I can, I go to the gym, lift some weight trying to recover my old shape, or least trying to stay healthy since now my life is based of being sit looking at the computer</p>

                <p>This proyect was made by me as final proyect for the course "Introduction to computer systems", and I needed to do a web page that could have a banner, navegation section and a footer. It's important to mention that it was my first ever proyect made.</p>

                <h3>Calculator</h3>
                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>This proyect was made by me. On the code, I tried not to use the math functions that Javascript already has, but instead, code the proccess of doing calculations such as square root, cos, equations, etc...</p>
                <p>This was probably one the best proyects so far I've made since it allow me to explore multiple way to code one thing.</p>
                <h4>Bibliography</h4>
                <p>For this proyect I used the following link in order to solve & guide my self to build the code: </p>
